# 05-Space-SHMUP
 
For this assignment (W5-Space SHMUP Add a feature), my goal was to create another weapon that explodes when it touches the enemy and as well as making another enemy that follows you around. I was not able to successfully do this because it was confusing me a lot and I was getting errors, however, I was able to change some visual effects of the hero, ships, shield, enemies, background, and weapon projectile. In addition to that, I adjusted some of the size, color, and speed on some enemies, weapons, and the hero.
